    <h2> What is C++?</h2>
    <p> C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. <br>
      C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. <br>
      C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. <br>
      The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. <br>
    <ul>Why Use C++
      <li> C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>
      <li> C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</li>
      <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs.</li>
      <li> C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</li>
      <li> C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li>
      <li> As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      Difference between C and C++
      <li> C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.</li>
      <li>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</li>
    </ul>
