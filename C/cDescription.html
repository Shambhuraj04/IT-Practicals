    <ul> Why Learn C?
      <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
      <li> If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python,
        C++,C#,etc, as the syntax is similar</li>
      <li>C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python</li>
      <li>C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Difference between C and C++ :
      <li> C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax</li>
